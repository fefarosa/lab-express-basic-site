    was a postal worker. His parents also served as foster parents for 14 years. Glover was

    Glover attended Lakeside High School and DeKalb School of the Arts, and was voted "Most 
    Likely to Write for The Simpsons" in his high school yearbook. In 2006, he graduated from 
    the New York University Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in Dramatic Writing. While 
    at Tisch, he self-produced the independent mixtape The Younger I Get, which was never 
    released and was later disowned by Glover for being the "too-raw ramblings" of what he 
    calls a "decrepit Drake." He also began DJing and producing electronic music under the 
    moniker MC D (later as mcDJ) remixing Sufjan Stevens' album Illinois (2005).
